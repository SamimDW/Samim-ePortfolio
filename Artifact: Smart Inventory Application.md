title: "Artifact: Smart Inventory Android Application"
---

## What it is
Smart Inventory is an Android application that enables users to create, update, and delete inventory items. The app displays items in a RecyclerView and provides summary statistics, such as the total number of items and low-stock counts, to support basic inventory tracking.

## When it was created
The original version of this application was created in CS 360 (Mobile Architecture and Programming). It was later selected and enhanced in CS 499 as part of the capstone project.

## Why I selected it
I selected this artifact because it provided a realistic foundation for demonstrating growth across all three required enhancement categories. The project already included a user interface, application logic, and data storage, which made it suitable for greater improvements that reflect real-world development challenges rather than isolated academic examples.

## What the enhancements improved
The enhancements focused on strengthening the application in three areas:
- Improving software design and security by migrating authentication to Firebase Authentication
- Improving usability and efficiency by adding search and filtering capabilities to the inventory list
- Improving data persistence and authorization by migrating inventory storage to Firebase Firestore and scoping data to the authenticated user
