title: "Professional Self-Assessment"
---


Completing the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University was a journey of shifting my focus from basic functionality to long-term sustainability. Early on, my goal was simply to get the code to run. Today, my definition of success is a system that is readable, testable, and secure. Developing this ePortfolio forced me to look at that evolution honestly, backing up my growth with concrete technical artifacts rather than just claims.

The transition from solo assignments to Agile-style coursework redefined my view of collaboration. Version control, code reviews, and thorough documentation moved from being academic requirements to being essential safeguards. In my CS 499 Capstone, I conducted an informal code review that mirrored real-world engineering discussions, identifying edge-case failures and proposing architectural improvements rather than just fixing syntax. This experience taught me that how we talk about code within a team is just as vital as the code itself.

I have also worked to bridge the gap between technical decisions and stakeholder needs. I believe an engineer’s value is doubled when they can explain the "why" behind a design to a non-technical audience. For my animal shelter dashboard project, I translated complex CRUD operations across the UI, API, and MongoDB into a clear narrative of how data moves through the system. Learning to articulate these trade-offs has become a cornerstone of my professional communication.

My approach to data structures and algorithms has evolved from theoretical study to practical application. In my Android Smart Inventory app, I implemented search and filtering logic designed to handle live data without compromising UI responsiveness. This project served as a deep dive into full-system design, forcing me to move beyond single functions to consider database structure, user scope, and lifecycle management. It highlighted why persistence and access control are the true foundations of a functional application.

I have also pushed into specialized areas like artificial intelligence and security to see how theory holds up under pressure. Whether training machine learning models using TensorFlow or implementing hashing to protect game session data, I learned that even the best logic is fragile if it is not enforced through intentional design. Security, in particular, became a proactive part of my workflow. By using the Google Test framework to write tests that intentionally try to break my code, I’ve shifted to a defensive mindset where I design for misuse rather than perfect conditions.

Ultimately, the artifacts in this ePortfolio represent a unified narrative of growth. The Android Smart Inventory app serves as the foundation, supported by projects that showcase my skills in software design, database integration, and scalability. These works reflect my ability to design and improve software that is robust enough to hold up outside the classroom.
