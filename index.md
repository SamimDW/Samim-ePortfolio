Completing the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University strengthened both my technical skills and my approach to problem-solving. Over the course of the program, I moved from writing code that simply worked to designing systems that are readable, maintainable, and secure. Developing this ePortfolio helped me reflect on that growth and present concrete evidence of how my coursework prepared me for real-world software development.

Throughout the program, I learned that effective collaboration is essential to building reliable software. In team-based and Agile-style coursework, I practiced breaking work into clear tasks, communicating design decisions, and responding to feedback through iteration. I learned to treat code reviews, documentation, and version control as part of collaboration, not as separate tasks. These experiences shaped how I approach teamwork, with an emphasis on clarity, shared ownership, and long-term maintainability.

I also developed strong communication skills by learning how to explain technical concepts to different audiences. Many assignments required translating complex behavior into clear written explanations, presentations, or walkthroughs. In CS 499, I produced an informal code review that mirrors how engineers discuss existing systems with peers or managers by explaining what the code does, where it falls short, and how it can be improved. This ability to communicate technical work clearly is something I consider just as important as writing the code itself.

My coursework strengthened my understanding of data structures and algorithms as practical tools rather than abstract theory. I learned to think about how data flows through a system and how design choices affect performance and usability. In later projects, I focused on efficient data access, filtering, and transformation so applications remain responsive as complexity increases. These skills helped me design features that scale beyond small, academic examples.

In software engineering and database design, I learned the value of clean architecture and separation of concerns. Early projects often relied on tightly coupled logic, but later work emphasized patterns that support testing, refactoring, and change. I also learned the limitations of local-only data storage and the importance of designing systems that support persistence, synchronization, and access control. These lessons shaped how I evaluate trade-offs between simplicity and scalability.

Security became a design consideration rather than an afterthought as I progressed through the program. I learned to recognize common risks such as unsafe credential handling, weak authorization boundaries, and excessive trust in client-side logic. My later work reflects a stronger security mindset, where authentication, data access, and user scope are built into the architecture from the beginning rather than added later.

The artifacts in this ePortfolio work together to demonstrate this progression. Rather than showcasing disconnected projects, the portfolio centers on a single application that was enhanced across software design, algorithms and data structures, and databases. Each enhancement builds on the previous one, resulting in a cohesive system that reflects real development practices. Together, these artifacts illustrate my ability to design, evaluate, and improve software in a way that delivers value while remaining maintainable and secure.
